# I had to create a whole new project 'KonsolApp' to be able to  use 
# /Shared project. 
#
# Known bugs:
# ContactAddviewModel.cs
# - NavigateToList() - Does not update the list with the new contact. Requires restarting the app. Why?
#
# TODO:
# - Add() in ContactEdit/AddViewModel.cs need to be cleaned up and seperate concerns.
# - Fix the delete button in the listview.
# - Finally create the setings menu in KonsolApp or rip it out of the menu. 
# - Add more summary commenting through the solution. 
# - Make more tests. Decide which tests go to Konsol - Wpf - Shared.
